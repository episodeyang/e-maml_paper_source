abstract = {Curiosity is an essential driving force for science as well as technology, and has led mankind to explore its surroundings, all the way to our current understanding of the uni-verse. Space science and exploration is at the pinnacle of each of these developments, in that it requires the most advanced technology, ex-plores our world and outer space, and con-stantly pushes the frontier of scientific knowl-edge. Manned space missions carry dispro-portionate costs and risks, so it is only natural for the field to strive for autonomous explo-ration. While recent innovations in engineer-ing, robotics and AI provide solutions to many sub-problems of autonomous exploration, in-sufficient emphasis has been on the higher level question of autonomously deciding what to explore. Artificial curiosity, the subject of this paper, precisely addresses this issue. We will introduce formal notions of " interesting-ness " based on the concepts of (1) compres-sion progress through discovery of novel regu-larities in the observations, and (2) coherence progress through selection of data that " fits " the already known data in a compression-based way. Further, we discuss how to con-struct a system that exhibits curiosity driven by the interestingness of certain types of novel observations, with the mission to curiously go where no probe has gone before.},

@article{Schmidhuber2015,
abstract = {This paper addresses the general problem of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. In 2013, our large RL recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learned from scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways. In particular, they learn a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs (RNNAIs) designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially "learning to think." The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a grant proposal submitted in Fall 2014, and also explain concepts such as "mirror neurons." Experimental results will be described in separate papers.},

@article{Storck1995,
abstract = {For an agent living in a non-deterministic Markov environment (NME), what is, in theory, the fastest way of acquiring information about its statistical properties? The answer is: to design "optimal" sequences of "experiments" by performing action sequences that maximize expected information gain. This notion is implemented by combining concepts from information theory and reinforcement learning. Experiments show that the resulting method, reinforcement driven information acquisition, can explore certain NMEs much faster than conventional random exploration.},
